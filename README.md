## Description

During my first year of studying Computer Science, I undertook a single-semester project centered around a "Film Society" concept. The project aimed to serve as a landing page for a university society dedicated to films.

In order to create a unique and visually appealing design, I experimented with various animations using the GSAP animation library. I also came up with a few distinctive designs that would suit the theme of the project.

Although originally developed as a team project, the design and code are entirely my own work. I decided to showcase my individual skills by focusing on the home page, cinematography page, and the preloader. The other test pages serve as a placeholder for the navigation menu that I implemented.
