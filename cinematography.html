         <h2 id='title'>WHAT IS CINEMATOGRAPHY</h2>
         <div class="description">
            <p>Cinematography is the art and craft of making motion pictures by capturing a story visually. Though, technically, cinematography is the art and the science of recording light either electronically onto an image sensor or chemically onto film.</p>
            <p>Taken from the Greek for "writing with movement," cinematography is the creation of images you see on screen. A series of shots that form a cohesive narrative. Cinematography composes each shot, considering, where everything in frame demands attention.</p>

         <h2 id='title'>BRIEF HISTORY</h2>
         <div class="description">
            <p>The history of cinematography began in the late 1880s, when people began combining multiple consecutive photos to create the illusion of a motion picture. The earliest surviving motion picture is the “Roundhay Garden Scene,” which was created in 1888 and is just 2.11 seconds long.</p>
            <p>From there, film evolved rapidly in the early 20th century. The early years of narrative film were characterized by experimentation and exploration as filmmakers strived to develop a visual language for storytelling despite technical limitations, like the absence of sound before 1929.</p>
            <p>One of the greatest shifts in the history of cinematography arrived as part of the New Hollywood era of the late 1960s and early 1970s. A wave of young DPs entered the profession as the old guard retired and union rules were relaxed to allow new memberships. Their timing was perfect, as a wave of visionary young directors had also entered the fray to make mind-blowing, era-defining films.</p>
            <p>Together, teams like Martin Scorsese and Michael Chapman (Taxi Driver), Robert Altman and Paul Lohmann (Nashville), Francis Ford Coppola and Gordon Willis (The Godfather), Mike Nichols and Robert Surtees (The Graduate), and Steven Spielberg and Bill Butler (Jaws) bucked long-held Hollywood restrictions on methodology and film content, defied industry conventions, and found new ways to artistically contribute to the language of film. The extraordinary work of all these artists (and many others of the time) helped create a new era of independent film that continues to this day.</p>

         <h2 class="titleII">CINEMATOGRAPHY AT ITS BEST</h2>
         <div class="cinemaExampleText">
            <h2>MR. ROBOT - TELLING A STORY THROUGH FRAMING - PART I</h2>
            <p>The TV Show Mr. Robot it's about Elliot, a brilliant but highly unstable young cyber-security engineer and vigilante hacker, becomes a key figure in a complex game of global dominance when he and his shadowy allies try to take down the corrupt corporation he works for.</p>
            <p>The atmosphere of the show created by director Sam Esmail, and the cinematographer Tod Campbell is the most unique I've seen in a long time, keeping you in a constant discomfort with a gut feeling that something feels off, while also creating balance between scenes through symmetry.</p>
            <p>Unlike conventional filmmaking, there is no leading room in conversation cuts, meaning the negative space is usually in front of the actor, not behind them. This refers to breathing room and gazing direction. Campbell pushes the face right up next to the edge to create excessive negative space. This all helps to create the visual tension he was looking to achieve.</p>
            <p>The frames are well thought and it shows from all the symbolism added. The meaning behind them add another level of story-telling to the narrative.</p>

            <h2 class="centerText">MR. ROBOT - TELLING A STORY THROUGH FRAMING - PART II</h2>
            <p class="centerTextII">Adding more context to the points mentioned above, I selected this scene to ilustrate the power a camera angle can have when telling a story. This example, even though it focuses on one aspect of cinematography, will evidentiate the depth the craft can have and it's many ways of cativating attention, stiring emotion and communicating a timeless story.</p>

            <h2>TELLING A STORY THROUGH COLOR</h2>
            <p class="colorP">Movies stir up emotions in ways you might not even realize. The composition of each individual shot in a film is crucial, as are the ideas that come with these shots. Whether it’s a certain aesthetic choice made when coloring, or the wardrobe and objects with which the frame is filled, color can manipulate the emotions of an audience on many different conscience and subconscious levels.</p>
            <p class="colorP">Obviously, colors can mean many different things and can be used in many different ways. There’s no right or wrong way to use blue, green, orange, etc. Finding an appealing and unique way to stir up feelings within your audience through the use of color is the real challenge. Let’s take a look at some of the different color motifs used in films and the emotions these colors bring to the surface.</p>
            <h2 id="colorTitle">RED</h2>
            <div id="example3" class="cinemaColorPic">
               <i id="btnLeft3" class="fas fa-angle-left"></i>
               <i id="btnRight3" class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>
               <p id="colorDescription">The meanings and intent that accompany the color red can vary — but there’s no denying it’s one of the most powerful colors to use on-screen. On one side of the spectrum, red is used as a way to show aggression, violence, and anger. Take the image above. This abrupt moment in Alex Garland’s Ex Machina is when the film takes a 180 and crosses into the realm of sinister. The encompassing red glow signifies a fresh intensity and serves as a cue for the audience to pay attention because something crucial is about to happen.</p>
